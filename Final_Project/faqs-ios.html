The number of puzzles solved reflects the number of full-size puzzles you've solved without using Check or Reveal. The solve rate is the number of puzzles solved over the number of puzzles attempted. Streaks reflect the number of consecutive daily puzzles solved without using Check or Reveal within their publication window [link to pub schedule question] (time when published until midnight of the printed publish date). The bar graph displays your average solve time by day of the week (in blue). Your best solve time is displayed in yellow. Your solve time for that day based on the current week is displayed in pink. A=average, T=time for this week, B=best time. Note: Using Check or Reveal disqualifies the puzzle solve time from streaks and the scorecard on the website.
